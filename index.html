        <b><div class="1" id="about">About</div></b>
        <p id="BB">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.<br><br>
        Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>

        <div class="2" id="history"> History</div></b>
        <p id="BB">In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian-American professor of physical education in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting many ideas, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.
        <br><br>Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.
        <br><br>The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.
        <br><br>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game.In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game.</p>

        <ol id="BB">
        <li>Basketball is a game in which five players from each team play at a time on the basketball court.</li>
        <li>The players aim to score a basket by putting the ball inside the hoop elevated 10 ft above the ground.</li>
        <li>The team with the ball in possession is the team on offense, and the opposition is the team on defense.</li>
        <li>Once the offensive team has the ball, they have 24 seconds on the shot clock to shoot it toward the basket. If the offensive team either fails to shoot the ball or fails to touch the rim or make the shot, a 24-second shot-clock violation is granted to the offensive team, resulting in a turnover. The shot clock was introduced in the NBA in 1954.</li>
        <li>If the offensive team fails to bring the ball up the court (beyond their backcourt) within eight seconds, an 8-second violation is called, resulting in a turnover.</li>
        <li>There can be a total of 12 players on the team roster, but only five can play at a time.</li>
        <li>The game of basketball consists of four quarters of 12 minutes each, and if scores are tied at the end of it, there is a five minutes’ extension called “overtime”.</li>
        <li>The scoring rules are simple. If you shoot from behind the arc, you will get three points whereas shots from inside the arc earn two points. Also, each free throw is worth a single point.</li>
        <li>There are a variety of ways to score 1, 2, 3, or 4 points on a single possession. For eg., While any shot within the three-point arc is considered to be worth 2 points, if the shooter is fouled during the upward motion of the shot, and the shot goes in, then the basket counts and the player gets a chance at an And-1 by getting one free throw as well. The shooter is granted 1 free throw (worth 1 point) and if the shooter makes the free throw, a three-point play is said to be completed. Similarly, if the player is fouled during a three-point shot and the shot goes in, he gets a chance at a four-point play.</li>

        <b><div class="5" id="how to get started">How To Get Started</div></b>
        <p id="BB">Most young players are scouted to play in college.
            If you’re a talented high school hoopster, coaches for college teams may eye you up for their team. They’ll watch how you play and see how you conduct yourself on and off the court to make sure you’re a good fit in their team. From there, the coach could offer you a scholarship or a position on the team so you can play at a higher level.
            Only 2% of high school basketball players continue playing once they reach college, so work really hard on your game to build your skills.<br>
            College athletes attend drafts to join professional teams.
            During a draft, professional teams take turns selecting their top picks of college players to sign. If you play really well in college and get the attention of the professional coaches, there’s a chance they may select you and offer you a contract.<br>
        
            Ask your coach to reach out for you.
            Talk to your coach about your dreams to play professionally and ask them if they have any connections to college scouts or coaches. Your coach will send them an email or give them a call to discuss your potential future. Your coach will give their honest opinion and put in a good word for you so you’re more likely to get noticed.
            Always maintain a good relationship with your coach so they’re more likely to talk you up.<br>
            You don’t need to formally declare your eligibility to the NBA if you went through college and played basketball. If you didn’t attend college but 4 years have passed since you graduated high school, you also are automatically considered for the draft.
            You have the best shot at getting drafted if you played for your college team throughout your time in school.<br>
            Show off your skills at the draft combine training in Chicago.
            This is one of your last shots to make an impression on scouts and coaches before the draft pick. At the combine, they’ll measure your height and weight as well as run skills tests for things like strength and vertical leap. You also have the chance to run basketball drills to showcase your abilities and convince NBA personnel that you’re a good addition to their team.
            You do not have to attend the combine if you don’t want to if you’re worried about getting injured or are confident in your ability. Some top draft picks in previous years didn’t attend the combine.<br>
